**Project**: HALO - Hierarchical Abstraction for Longform Optimization

---

## 📋 Project Summary

### 🎯 **Objective**
Develop production-ready tools for optimizing AI model usage in long-form video analysis, addressing the challenge of cost-effective and efficient processing of multimedia content with large language models and vision APIs.

### 🔬 **Research Problem**
Long-form video analysis with AI models like Google's Gemini Vision API faces significant challenges:
- **High computational costs** due to frame-by-frame processing
- **Redundant analysis** of similar consecutive frames
- **Poor scalability** for videos longer than a few minutes
- **Inefficient resource utilization** leading to slow processing

### 💡 **Solution: HALO Algorithm**
HALO (Hierarchical Abstraction for Longform Optimization) implements:
1. **Intelligent Frame Sampling**: Optimized 15-second intervals based on video content analysis
2. **Progressive Content Abstraction**: Hierarchical processing to minimize redundant analysis
3. **Context-Aware Caching**: Smart caching system to avoid duplicate API calls
4. **Batch Processing Optimization**: Strategic API call batching for improved efficiency

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### 🎬 **Core Components**

#### 1. **Frame Extraction Engine** (`transcript_utils.py`)
```python
# Intelligent frame sampling with optimized intervals
def extract_frames_at_intervals(video_path: str, interval: int = 15) -> List[str]:
    """Extract frames at scientifically optimized intervals"""
    # FFmpeg integration with performance optimization
    # Memory-efficient processing without temporary storage
```

#### 2. **AI Processing Engine** (`gemini_batch_predictor.py`)
```python
# Batch processing for improved API efficiency
class GeminiBatchPredictor:
    """Optimized batch processing for Gemini Vision API"""
    def __init__(self, api_key: str, cache_enabled: bool = True):
        # Smart batching and response caching
        # Error handling with exponential backoff
```

#### 3. **Hierarchical Caching System** (`context_cache.py`)
```python
# Context-aware caching for API optimization
class ContextCache:
    """Intelligent caching system for API responses"""
    def get_cached_response(self, content_hash: str) -> Optional[str]:
        # SQLite-based caching with content similarity detection
        # Cache invalidation and management strategies
```

#### 4. **Configuration Management** (`config_manager.py`)
```python
# Secure configuration and API key management
class ConfigManager:
    """Cross-platform configuration management"""
    def secure_key_storage(self, api_key: str) -> None:
        # Encrypted API key storage
        # Environment variable support
```

#### 5. **Interactive CLI** (`cli.py`)
```python
# Rich terminal interface with guided workflows
def interactive_cli():
    """Production-ready CLI with comprehensive user experience"""
    # Progress tracking and error recovery
    # Professional welcome screens and help system
```
